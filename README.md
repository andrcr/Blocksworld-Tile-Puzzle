# Blocksworld-Tile-Puzzle-Intelligent-Systems-Coursework


This is a coursework I had in the second year of university. It consisted in solving a problem using depth first, breadth first, iterative deepening and A* heuristic search to solve the problem.

The Problem: 

   An ‘agent’ moves in a simulated NxN grid world with the goal of building towers of blocks. Each grid space contains either a ‘tile’ or the agent. Some tiles have letters on them – these are the ‘blocks’. All the other tiles are white. The agent moves up/down/left/right (except where borders prevent it). As the agent moves, the tile that they move onto slides under them into the position that they just came from (see 8-puzzle). Some examples of moves are given overleaf. The exact start state and goal state for the assignment is shown below. The goal is to build a tower, with these exact blocks in these exact positions as shown. The position of the agent at the end doesn’t matter. (There are pictures and a more detailed description of the coursework requirements in the Problem.pdf file , and a detailed description of the code and some extra features in the Report.pdf)
